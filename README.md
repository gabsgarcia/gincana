Players4Players

Final Project for the Le Wagon Bootcamp Full Stack Web Developer.

A Game platform for players that don't have much free time, to find other players in the same situation, but what to have company or CoOp to play.

Game platform with a data base of free online games where the players can find a game they would like to play, they can save this game into a list or just create a game session where they can find other players to play that game in that date and time and use the chat to work the details.


Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
